<H1> HOW TO approach & solve an algorithm problem </H1>

### **Understanding & Clarification**

1. **What exactly is being asked?**
  - Sometimes problems are not stated clearly. Ensure you understand the task at hand.
2. **Are there any constraints or limitations?**
  - Time complexity? Space complexity? Are in-place modifications allowed or not?
3. **What should be done in the case of edge cases or ambiguities?**
  - What happens with an empty array? What if **`k`** is zero or greater than the array size? What if there are duplicates or negative numbers?
4. **What is the expected output format?**
  - Sometimes it's not just about the right answer but also how it should be returned. Array, string, integer, etc?

### **Data Exploration**

1. **What does the input data look like?**
  - Is the array sorted? Are the elements integers, strings, or custom objects?
2. **What are the data ranges?**
  - How big/small can the integers be? What is the max/min length for the array?

### **Algorithm & Strategy**

1. **What type of problem is it?**
  - Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, backtracking, etc.
2. **Is recursion an option?**
  - Sometimes recursion simplifies the problem. But can you afford the stack space?
3. **What data structures might help?**
  - Would a hash table be useful for quick lookups? Would a stack or queue help in traversal?

### **Optimization & Efficiency**

1. **How efficient is your first approach?**
  - Always good to have a solution first. Then think, can it be optimized?
2. **Are there any steps that can be parallelized or broken down further?**
  - Given your interest in dev-ops, this might be particularly relevant.
3. **What's the trade-off?**
  - Sometimes you trade time complexity for space, or vice versa. Is it warranted?

### **Testing**

1. **How will you validate your solution?**
  - Through unit tests, manual validation, or some other way?
2. **What are the corner cases?**
  - These can sometimes trip you up if you haven't considered them.

### **Discussion & Presentation**

1. **How will you articulate your solution to others?**
  - Sometimes the discussion with the interviewer is as important as getting the right answer.
2. **Are there alternative approaches?**
  - Always good to discuss or at least think about other possible solutions.
